# Portfolio: 

## Description 

In this assignment, I created a portfolio website which displays the work I have done so far. I included three websites that I have completed; refactoring a code, collecting contact information, and a mini project. 

This portfolio was created to put my work out for potential employers to see in one space.

This portfolio was created using HTML and CSS. A navigation bar was added to with a header. Three sections were made and divided by content; about me, projects and contact me. 

Example of Navbar used:
```
 <header>
      <h1>Web Development</h1>
        <nav>
            <a class="active" href="#home">Home</a>
            <a href="#spy-about">About me</a>
            <a href="#spy-projects">Projects</a>
            <a href="#spy-contact">Contact Me</a>
       </nav>
  </header> 
```
